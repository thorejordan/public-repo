# TryHackMe Module Data Repository

This repository contains structured JSON datasets describing TryHackMe-style cybersecurity learning modules. It currently includes:

- `structured_tryhackme_modules.json`: Four richly attributed module entries for analytics and curriculum planning.
- Raw text/JSON exports from earlier data collection efforts (e.g., `THM_Rooms_Sheet1.json`, `teams1_raw.txt`).

## GUI Availability
There is no graphical user interface in this repository. It provides data files only; no web front-end or desktop client is included.

## Usage
Consume the JSON files directly in data pipelines, BI tools, or recommendation engines. No build or runtime steps are required beyond standard JSON processing.
